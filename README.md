# 👋 Hello, I'm MARIA
I am currently transitioning into the field of data analysis 📊. I am a Chemical Engineer with 12 years of experience in the oil and automotive industries within Health, Safety, and Environmental roles 🛡️, where I developed strong skills working with operational and compliance data. In my previous positions, I performed **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization** to support key business decisions 📈, which sparked my interest in specializing in **Data Analytics**.
